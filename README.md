This is forked from https://github.com/sb2nov/resume, who is responsible for the beautiful formatting. I have substituted his qualifications for my own.

A single-page, one-column resume for software developers. It uses the base latex templates and fonts to provide ease of use and installation when trying to update the resume. The different sections are clearly documented and custom commands are used to provide consistent formatting. The three main sections in the resume are education, experience, and projects.
